        <p>My name is Hannes Waldstamm, I am a professional photographer and I love to take pictures in every kind of way.</p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <p>I was born in Vienna, Austria, and spent most
          of my youth there, before I went to study photography at the Sp√©os Paris Photographic Institute. Now I live in
          Vienna again.
          I often travel for work, always looking forward to finding new places and meeting new people.</p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <p>Since I was a small child, I have always had a keen interest in photography, how a camera is constructed, how it
          works and how pictures are taken was always a fascinating marvel to me!</p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <p>I do a lot of landscape photos, along with aesthetic and sensual portraits, optical illusions, streetstyles. I
          cooporate with professional agencies around the world and was fortunate enough to gain a lot of
          experience already. Feel
          free to have a look at some of my certificates and awards below, to get a more in depth understanding of my
          qualifications as well as my journey in the art of photography.</p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <p>I hope you enjoy my photography. If so, and if you would like to work with me, please use my contact page or
          various social media channels to leave a message. I am looking forward to meet you!
